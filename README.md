# EXPERIMENT-6
## AIM:To write a Python program for checking Palindrome and to write test cases for ir. 

## ALGORITHM
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Get an input from the user by prompting
Step 3: Run a loop form 0 to len/2.
Step 4: Check if the characters are the same both from the start and the end till len/2.
Step 5: If it is, return the result that it is a palindrome.
Step 6: Else, return that it is not a palindrome.
Step 7: Stop.
